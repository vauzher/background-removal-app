# background-removal-app
This is a Flask-based web application that allows users to remove the background from images. The app utilizes the rembg library, combined with the power of Pillow (PIL) for image processing. Users can upload images in formats like PNG, JPEG, and JPG, and the app will return the image with the background removed.
